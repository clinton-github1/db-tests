The most frequent cause of male\r\ninfertility is low sperm count or an anatomical abnormality. Sperm factors account for 40% of all cases\r\nof infertility.\r\nFactors affecting this include excessive heat to the testes, exposure to toxins or radiation alcohol\r\nconsumption, endocrine disorders, recent acute illness, or prolonged fever. Any viral illness associated\r\nwith a fever up to 3 months earlier. Testicular mumps is another cause.\r\nA very common structural damage problem in men is a varicocele. This is a dilated vein of the spermatic\r\nduct.\r\nIf your sperm count is healthy, a cold or flue probably will affect it. But if sperm count is borderline, an\r\nillness might render you infertile for a time.', 'TREATMENTâ€”\r\nâ€¢ Obtain an adequate diet, including enough protein, essential fatty acids, and, if\r\nnecessary, digestive aids.\r\nâ€¢ Pay special attention to selenium deficiency as a factor in male infertility.\r\nâ€¢ Strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet has enabled some men, who previously thought\r\nthey were sterile, to become fathers.\r\nâ€¢ Do not use anabolic steroids! They can shut down the pituitary gland and throw the\r\nbody''s hormonal system out of balance. Athletes often have fertility problems. Long-time\r\nuse of steroids can permanently damage the testicles.\r\nâ€¢ Drinking alcohol reduces sperm count in men.\r\nâ€¢ Do not overheat the testes. If you do, they will produce sterile sperm for several hours or\r\nup to a day afterward. The testes must remain a half degree cooler than your core body temperature. Fevers to the body, close-fitting underwear, or hot tub baths can cause this.\r\nâ€¢ Do not have intercourse for several days prior to the special fertile time.\r\nâ€¢ Tagamet and Zantac, two ulcer medications, decrease sperm counts and may even\r\nproduce impotence.\r\nâ€¢ In some cases, sperm count is so low that the only means of fertilization is artificial\r\ninsemination.\r\nâ€¢ If a varicocele is the problem, it must be treated by surgery.\r\nâ€”Also see "Infertility, Female" for additional nutritional and many, many, other factors.

Avoid foods that require chewing or might\r\nbe irritating. Eat mostly raw fruits and vegetables that are juiced or softened.\r\nâ€¢ Drink plenty of pure water and fresh juices. This will keep the body working well, help\r\nflush toxins, and render it less likely that complications may occur.\r\nâ€¢ Do not eat junk food of any type. Avoid caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, soft drinks, etc.\r\nAvoid acidic foods, such as pickles or citrus fruits.\r\nâ€¢ To relieve pain, cold or warm compresses (whichever feels best) may be placed on the\r\nneck and over the glands. But avoid hot or icy cold applications.\r\nâ€¢ If nausea and/or pain on swallowing becomes so severe that the person becomes unable\r\nto eat, intravenous administration of dextrose and fluids may be needed.\r\nâ€¢ Do not give aspirin to a child or youth with a fever; it may result in death!'),

('CHPF/1735', 'DIABETES-1', 'SYMPTOMSâ€”Diabetes insipidus: Extreme thirst and enormous quantities of urine, regardless of how\r\nmuch water is consumed.\r\nDiabetes mellitus - Type I: (insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes): Excessive hunger, thirst, urination,\r\ndepression, weakness, blurred vision, dry mouth, and vomiting.\r\nDiabetes mellitus - Type II: (maturity-onset diabetes): Unusual thirst, frequent urination, general\r\nweakness, obesity, skin disorders, boils, blurred vision, and dry mouth.\r\nCAUSESâ€”Diabetes is a major problem; entire books have been written on the subject. We can only\r\ntouch on the subject here.\r\nOf the two types of diabetes, diabetes insipidus is the more rare and is caused by an inadequately\r\nfunctioning pituitary hormone (vasopressin) or kidneys which somehow cannot respond properly to it.\r\n\r\nDiabetes mellitus is the third largest killer in the U.S., and is caused by a defect in the production of\r\ninsulin by the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot utilize glucose, which is an important blood\r\nsugar. A blood glucose level above 180 mg. percent causes excess sugar to spillover into the urine and\r\nmake it sweet. (Mellitus means "sweet.") Diabetes comes from a Greek word for "flow through," since\r\ndiabetics produce so much urine.\r\nSome people can develop diabetes mellitus as a result of stress, obesity, or pregnancy. Certain medicinal\r\ndrugs can also cause it: oral contraceptives, adrenal corticosteroids, phenytoin, or thiazide diuretics. A\r\ndiet high in sugar and white flour can lead to diabetes. Parasites (especially in children) can also do it.\r\nHypothyroidism can also cause it.\r\nIt is of interest that people who eat much sugar eventually cannot taste it as well; so they pour on more\r\nsugar! But Type II diabetes sufferers also lack this sugar-tasting discernment. Leave off the sugar, and learn to enjoy the natural flavors in your food.\r\nBecause the diabetic cannot utilize glucose for energy, he loses weight and is weakened by excess\r\nconsumption of his protein and fat stores. Because of this, he may be very hungry and eat large amounts\r\nof food.', 'TREATMENTâ€”\r\nâ€¢ Stop eating sugar, white-flour products, greasy food, meat, eggs, cheese, excess\r\nvegetable oil, as well as rancid nuts and seeds. Totally avoid tobacco and those who use it.\r\nBecause it restricts circulation, it will aggravate your condition.\r\nâ€¢ Eat smaller meals (if necessary, eat them more frequently), and chew the food\r\nthoroughly. Do not eat late in the evening. Overeating can induce diabetes or increase it,\r\nonce contracted.\r\nâ€¢ Vegetable broths and fresh fruit are nourishing. A high-carbohydrate, high-fiber diet will\r\nreduce the need for insulin. (A low-fiber diet can bring on diabetes.) It will also lower the\r\namount of fat in the blood. Get your protein from vegetable sources.\r\nâ€¢ Onions and green beans appear to lower blood sugar. A diet high in raw food is also\r\nhelpful. One individual dropped his insulin dosage from 60 to 15 units per day, by\r\nincreasing his raw food intake.\r\nâ€¢ But do not eat fruits and melons in large amounts. Do not eat apples or bananas. Do not\r\neat milk and sugar combinations. Coffee can induce very high blood sugar levels. A fat-\r\nfree diet will help reduce blood sugar.\r\nâ€¢ Eat your meals at regular times, and do not be in a rush to swallow the food. The quicker\r\nyou eat, the higher goes the blood sugar.\r\nâ€¢ Eat raw garlic every day, to reduce your blood sugar.\r\nâ€¢ Do not take large amounts of niacin (vitamin B 3 ), B 1 (thiamin), PABA (para-\r\naminobenzoic acid, another B vitamin), or vitamin C. But do take them in normal\r\namounts.\r\nâ€¢ Get enough exercise; it will improve circulation, which is always poor in diabetics. This\r\nwill also lower blood sugar levels.\r\nâ€¢ Huckleberry helps promote insulin production. Cedar berries help the pancreas. Otherhelpful herbs include black walnut, echinacea, burdock, buchu, dandelion root, and uva\r\nursi.\r\nâ€¢ In case of a hyperglycemia attack, go to an emergency room. You must be given fluids,electrolytes, and possibly insulin.\r\nâ€¢ In case hypoglycemia occurs, in an emergency, immediately drink fruit juice, soft drinks,\r\nor anything else that contains sugar. If you are insulin dependent, carry a glucagon kit\r\nwith you at all times.\r\nâ€¢ If your child has diabetes, tell his teacher the warning signs of hypoglycemia and\r\nhyperglycemia.\r\nâ€¢ Take good care of your feet, for they can become more easily infected than those of non-\r\ndiabetics.'),
('CHPF/1793', 'FRACTURE (Broken Bone)', 'SYMPTOMSâ€”There may be extreme pain and tenderness in the injured area, a\r\nprotruding bone, blood under the skin, or swelling. There may be tingling,\r\nnumbness, weakness, or paralysis below the fracture.\r\nA digit, or limb, may be at an abnormal angle or there may be pain at a specific\r\nplace on a bone.\r\nA major fracture can cause a loss of pulse below the fracture, weakness, and\r\ninability to bear weight.\r\nCAUSESâ€”A fracture is a crack or break in a bone. If the skin over the bone\r\nremains intact, it is a closed or simple fracture; if the bone breaks the skin, it is a\r\ncompound fracture.\r\nAccidents are not a common cause of broken bones, but the bone can also be\r\nweakened from osteoporosis, bone tumors, or metabolic disease. A weakened\r\nbone can break much more easilyâ€”even from a slip of the foot, a slight fall, or\r\nknocking against something.\r\nMalnutrition can also be involved. There can be a deficiency of calcium and/or\r\nmagnesium, or there may be an improper calcium/phosphorous ratio.\r\nA vibrating tuning fork can be placed against the area; if it causes pain, there is a\r\nfracture. X rays will confirm whether it is a fracture or strain or sprain.\r\nIt is important that the bone be properly set, so it will not thenceforth be\r\ndeformed, and not function as well.\r\nOlder people do not absorb calcium and other minerals as well. This begins at\r\n40, increases at 50, and very much so beyond 60. It is believed that 200,000 hip\r\nfractures occur in people over 65 every year. Very often, this results from osteoporosis. The bone has somewhat hollowed out and the break more easily occurred.\r\nOlder people who take tranquilizers have 70% more hip fractures than other\r\npeople their age.\r\n\r\nWhen a break occurs, protein fibers form a bridgework between the two parts.\r\nThen calcium, phosphorous, and silica are deposited between the protein fibers.\r\n\r\nFirst aid includes covering any wound and immobilizing, or splinting, the broken\r\npart in the position it was found (so the problem will not worsen during\r\ntransport). Take the person to a physician or the hospital, depending on the\r\nseriousness of the problem. Medical treatment involves placing the bones in their\r\nproper position and keeping them there while healing occurs.', 'TREATMENTâ€”\r\nâ€¢ Obtain a nourishing diet. (See "Bones, Strengthening," just\r\nbelow.)\r\nâ€¢ Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme which acts to reduce\r\nswelling and inflammation. Eat half a fresh (not canned or\r\nprocessed) pineapple daily, until the fracture heals. Canned\r\npineapple or pineapple juice may contain aluminum salts, pulled\r\nby the acid from the can by the very acid liquid.\r\nâ€¢ During healing, the diet should include enough calories in order\r\nto provide the energy necessary for new bone-cell formation.\r\nâ€¢ You may use clay poultices to alleviate bruising and swelling.\r\nâ€¢ Helpful herbs include comfrey and alfalfa. Also helpful are\r\nplantain and mistletoe.\r\nâ€¢ Also place comfrey over the site of the fracture, to speed healing\r\nand reduce pain and swelling.\r\nâ€¢ Too much calcium supplementation, during bone healing, can\r\ninduce kidney stone formation during the immobile period while\r\nthe cast is on. The problem is that the person is not active enough ENCOURAGEMENTâ€”The grace of Christ and the law of God are\r\ninseparable. In Jesus, mercy and truth are met together. By His death and\r\nmediation, Jesus can forgive our sins and enable us to resist temptation and live\r\nclean, godly lives.'),
('CHPF/1868', 'MALARIA', 'SYMPTOMSâ€”Chills occur for several hours, followed by drenching sweats every 1-3 days.\r\nCAUSESâ€”There are four types of parasites which are introduced into the bloodstream by the anopheles\r\nmosquito. If the disease becomes chronic (recurrent), it results in general debility, anemia, and an\r\nenlarged spleen.\r\nSevere cases can be very debilitating. An especially deadly form is called blackwater fever. The skin\r\ntakes on a yellow tint and the urine becomes progressively darker in color. Few people survive three\r\nattacks of blackwater fever.\r\nThis disease generally occurs only in tropical climates, but it can and does occur in the United States as\r\nwell.', 'TREATMENTâ€”\r\nâ€¢ Call a physician.\r\nâ€¢ There are two primary ways to treat malaria:\r\nâ€¢ One way is by taking quinine. This is an extract of the bark of the cinchona tree. Quinine \r\nwill generally eliminate the malaria, but a mild to severe hearing loss may also result.\r\nâ€¢ The other way is to give hot and cold water treatments to the person. This takes work.\r\nThe result is equally good, but no hearing loss results.\r\nâ€¢ During the fever, give cold applications (cool wet sheet packs, sponge him off with cool\r\nwater, etc.). During the chills, give him hot applications (hot packs).\r\nâ€¢ Give goldenseal tea. '),
('CHPF/1875', 'FEMALE INFERTILITYâ€”1 (Female Fertility Problems)', 'SYMPTOMSâ€”Seeming inability of a woman to become pregnant.\r\nCAUSESâ€”Infertility is generally defined as the failure to conceive after a year or more of regular\r\nsexual activity during the time of ovulation. Either the woman or the man may be the cause (see\r\n"Impotence, Male"). Infertility usually means that the problem can be reversed; sterility means that the\r\nsituation is permanent. An estimated 20% of American couples experience infertility. Determining the\r\nexact cause can be difficult.\r\nIn general, 60% of couples conceive within 6 months, and 90% within a year. If you both are under 28,\r\nand have no reason to think otherwise, you ought to have a baby within a year.\r\nA frequent cause is a deficiency in one or more nutrients.\r\nThe problem may be that the woman is not cycling and ovulating properly. If she has less than 20%\r\nbody fat, she may not.\r\nOther causes include inherited disorders, infections, venereal disease, mishandled abortions,\r\nendometriosis, bacterial organisms, drugs, plugged fallopian tubes, emotional trauma, or frigidity (which\r\nsee).\r\nIf you are producing milk or have male-pattern hair growth on your breasts, upper lip, or chin, you may\r\nhave a hormonal imbalance.\r\nYou or your spouse may have had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease which can destroy the\r\nfallopian tubes in women and inflame and scar the ductile system in men. Over 4,000 Americans\r\ncontract this disease yearly.\r\n\r\nYou may have had pelvic infections, endometriosis, polycystic ovary disease, abdominal or urinary tract\r\nsurgery, injuries to the perineum, excessively high fevers, the mumps or measles. You may have used an\r\nintrauterine device (IUD).\r\nOne of you may have been exposed to a harmful chemical, such as lead.\r\nKidney problems can result in reproductive imbalances. Clean out the kidneys.\r\nIn rare instances, women develop antibodies to their partner''s sperm.\r\nIn some cases, one or the other is only half-hearted about having a baby.', 'TREATMENTâ€”â€¢ Eat a nourishing diet; be sure to supplement it with sufficient vitamins and minerals and,\r\nif necessary, digestive aids. A high-protein diet, essential fatty acids, vitamins A, B\r\ncomplex, zinc, germanium, and CoQ10.\r\nâ€¢ A deficiency of selenium can lead to infertility in women.\r\nâ€¢ Vitamin E is very important if you wish to conceive.\r\nâ€¢ Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a B vitamin which stimulates the pituitary gland and\r\nsometimes restores fertility to a woman.\r\nâ€¢ Test for food allergies (see "Pulse Test").\r\nâ€¢ Avoid white flour, fried, sugar, junk, and caffeine foods. Do not eat animal fats.\r\nâ€¢ A gluten-free diet has enabled women, who previously were unable to conceive, to\r\nbecome pregnant.\r\nâ€¢ Stop smoking and do not be around cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Avoid caffeine and medicinal drugs. Caffeine can prevent pregnancy from beginning.\r\nâ€¢ There is the possibility that you have had heavy metal poisoning.\r\nâ€¢ Women who drink alcohol can prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in their womb.\r\nâ€¢ Helpful herbs include black cohosh, red clover, yellow dock, wild yam, chamomile,\r\nskullcap, dong quai.\r\nâ€¢ Black cohosh balances hormones, False unicorn, wild yam, and dong quai help increase\r\nfertility.\r\nâ€¢ The use of natural progesterone cream has helped many women become pregnant. An\r\nexcellent alternative is wild yam, which contains progesterone. Rub it on the abdomen.\r\nâ€¢ Avoid stress.\r\nâ€¢ The closer a woman''s weight is to the ideal, the more likely she is to conceive.\r\nâ€¢ Do not exercise too much at that time. It can, in some, cause a skipped ovulation or\r\nincrease infertility.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Avoid hot tubs and saunas, for they may cause changes in ovulation.\r\nâ€¢ Do not douche. It can interfere with vaginal pH. Beware of commercial douches,\r\nlubrication agents, and jellies.\r\nâ€¢ Use egg whites instead of petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly might kill the sperm; the egg\r\nwhites may help them in their journey. Only use egg whites during the few days each\r\nmonth when the woman is fertile. Egg whites are pure protein; a study, in Canada, found\r\nthat it was the best lubricant to use if conception was desired. Take the egg out of the\r\nrefrigerator earlier, so it will not be cold, and separate the yolk form the white.\r\nâ€¢ Do not work so hard that you are fatigued. It is well-known that people who go on a\r\nvacation trip are more likely to conceive. They have more time to relax and rest up.\r\nâ€¢ Make sure you time it just right.\r\nâ€¢ The woman should remain lying down for 20 minutes after ejaculation.\r\nâ€¢ If a woman has developed antibodies to her husband''s sperm, avoid releasing sperm for a\r\nmonth (via a condom, etc.). This should cause the sperm antibodies to decrease.\r\nâ€¢ There is always risk if you give consent for a physician to do fertility testing inside your\r\nbody.');
